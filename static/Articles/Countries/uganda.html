<h2>Uganda</h2>
<p>Uganda, officially the Republic of Uganda (Swahili: Jamhuri ya Uganda), is a landlocked country in East-Central Africa. It is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania. The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region. Uganda also lies within the Nile basin, and has a varied but generally a modified equatorial climate.</p>
<p>Uganda takes its name from the Buganda kingdom, which encompasses a large portion of the south of the country, including the capital Kampala. The people of Uganda were hunter-gatherers until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago, when Bantu-speaking populations migrated to the southern parts of the country.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1894, the area was ruled as a protectorate by the UK, who established administrative law across the territory. Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962. The period since then has been marked by violent conflicts, including an eight-year-long far right military dictatorship led by Idi Amin. Additionally, a lengthy civil war against the Lord's Resistance Army in the Northern Region led by Joseph Kony, has caused hundreds of thousands of casualties.</p>
<p>The official languages are English and Swahili, although "any other language may be used as a medium of instruction in schools or other educational institutions or for legislative, administrative or judicial purposes as may be prescribed by law." Luganda, a central language, is widely spoken across the country, and several other languages are also spoken, including Runyoro, Runyankole, Rukiga, and Luo.</p>
<p>The current president of Uganda is Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who came to power in January 1986 after a protracted six-year guerrilla war. Following constitutional amendments that removed term limits for the president, he was able to stand and was elected president of Uganda in the 2011, 2016 and in the 2021 general elections.</p>
<p>Uganda is a presidential republic, in which the President of Uganda is both head of state and head of government. There is a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The system is based on a democratic parliamentary system with universal suffrage for all citizens over 18 of years age. In a measure ostensibly designed to reduce sectarian violence, political parties were restricted in their activities from 1986. In the non-party "Movement" system instituted by Museveni, political parties continued to exist but could not campaign in elections or field candidates directly (although electoral candidates could belong to political parties). A constitutional referendum cancelled this 19-year ban on multi-party politics in July 2005.</p>
<p>Uganda is divided into 135 districts and the capital city of Kampala, which are grouped into four administrative regions.</p>
<p>Uganda has 60 protected areas, including ten national parks: Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Rwenzori Mountains National Park (both UNESCO World Heritage Sites), Kibale National Park, Kidepo Valley National Park, Lake Mburo National Park, Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, Mount Elgon National Park, Murchison Falls National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park, and Semuliki National Park. The country has 10 national forests.</p>
<p>There are 13 wildlife reserves, including the Toro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, and the Katonga Wildlife Reserve. Uganda has 7 Ramsar sites: the Lake Bisina Wetland System, Mabamba Bay Wetland System, Lutembe Bay Wetland System, Murchison Falls National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park, Semuliki National Park, and the Sango Bay-Musambwa Island-Kagera System.</p>
<p>Uganda has a total area of 241,038 square kilometres (93,072 sq mi), of which 197,100 square kilometres (76,100 sq mi) is land and 43,938 square kilometres (16,998 sq mi) is water. The country is mostly plateau with a rim of mountains. The climate is tropical and generally rainy with two dry seasons (December to February, June to August). Uganda lies almost completely within the Nile basin. The Victoria Nile drains from the lake into Lake Kyoga and thence into Lake Albert on the Congolese border. It then runs northwards into South Sudan. An area in eastern Uganda is drained by the Suam River, part of the internal drainage basin of Lake Turkana. The extreme north-eastern part of Uganda drains into the Lotikipi Basin, which is primarily in Kenya.</p>
<h3>Vanilla production</h3>
<p>Uganda is the second largest vanilla producer in the world, after Madagascar. The country produces 200 metric tons of vanilla annually, according to the Uganda Vanilla Exporters and Vanilla Sector Players Association (UVESSPA). The crop is grown mainly in the districts of Mukono, Jinja, Iganga, Kamuli, Kaliro, Mbale, Tororo, Butaleja, Bugiri, Luuka, and Mayuge.</p>
