        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>What is VanillaWiki?</h2>
        <p>This is just a little side project where I make a website using absolutely minimal libraries</p>
        <p>You can read more about it and see the source code at the <a href="https://github.com/Master-Mind/VanillaWiki">github repo</a>.</p>
        <p>Note that this is hosted on free tier everything, so a cold start takes ~1-5 minutes, the server is in Oregon (as of me writing this), and you might be able to ddos it by refreshing too fast</p>
